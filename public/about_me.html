    Kuboni was born in the eastern cape of South Africa where he received his primary and secondary education at one of the country's premier primary and secondary schools, Selborne. 
It was not until his early twenties that he pursued his love for the arts. Teaching himself the bass guitar he was later able to gain entrance into the university of the Witwatersrand where he was trained in his craft by musicians such as Carlo Mombelli, Malcolm Nay, Jonathan Crossley, and Bryan Schimmel.

    Before he was able to complete his degree in music, Kuboni was already cast to play the bass on professional shows such as Dreamgirls and Dirty Dancing and it is here that his love affair with musical theatre flourished. In 2017 Kuboni worked alongside Charl-Johan Lingenfelder as musical director and bandleader of the Fugard theatre's revival the Todd Matshikiza classic, King Kong. 
The show would garner rave reviews and earn Sipumzo a first Naledi award nomination and in addition, for his work in the music industry, he was selected as one The Mail and Guardian's top 200 young South Africans, 2018. He would go on to serve as the composer on The Cape Town opera's production of the high School Opera, Imivumba YamaQhawe as well band leader in David Kramer's Langarm.
